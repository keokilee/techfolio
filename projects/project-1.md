summary: Create party invities for your guests and send them via text message
---

Hobnob is an event invitations app for iOS and Android. Hosts will enter in their event details (name, date/time, and location) and then select a design for their invite. After that, the host will select guests from their phone contacts and any other details. The invites are then sent out via text message. Guests receive the flyer design along with a link to view the event's details on the web. To RSVP for the event, guests can either go to the event's web page or respond directly using SMS. Guests who also have the app will be able to view the event details within the app and chat guests or the hosts.

I have been a software engineer at Hobnob since November, 2015. Since then, we created a new web invite frontend using React.js, which takes advantage of several modern frontend techniques including server side rendering and client side routing. We have also built numerous features on the main API web server, including the ability to send invites to email addresses and adding cohosts. We also built a chat messaging service built on Elixir and Phoenix. Since Elixir runs on the battle-tested Erlang VM, it is able to handle the amount of traffic we get on the service.
