  This was the first assignment we did in C code after doing the standard “Hello World”. It was pretty simple looking back now but at the time I just couldn’t figure it out. After a lot of trial and error to get it going in the beginning I finally managed to find the problem. I had missed one of my curly braces and somehow managed to call a function recursively when it was only supposed to be called once. Considering all the hassle I went through because of one curly brace, I was super happy and at the same time mad, all because of ONE curly brace. Another funny part to this was I used VIM for the entire semester for that class only because I couldn’t figure out pico or the other text editors in the beginning and by the time the teacher posted a tutorial for pico and the other editors, I was like “Naw, I’ll stick with VIM.” That probably wasn’t the best choice but it became habit after a while. In fact I find that sometimes I’ll hit :wq when I want to save a project file.

  This one taught me a lesson in not being stubborn and that I should always check my braces first, otherwise life will suck a lot. Serious note though this was really cool for me since this was basic considering the stuff that came later but it was still super memorable.
